### Absenteeism at work 
_Machine learning based model_

Employee Absenteeism is a manager's nightmare in every courier company. It affects
planning, production, efficiency, functioning and managerial effectiveness of the organization
with heavy additional expenses involved. The objective of this project is to apply machine
learning algorithms in the prediction of absenteeism at work.

The main components of this project are 
* Data Cleaning 
* Exploratory data analysis 
* Model Creation 
* Model Evaluation 

# Data
The raw database is the information collected records of absenteeism from work during
the period of July/07 to July/2010 in a Courier company.(Data is acquired from [UCI machine learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Absenteeism+at+work))

# Results 

To predict the number of absent hours, reason for absence is the most
important factor.The other important factors are Transportation expense, Day of the week,
Month of absence, Age and Work load on average basis.Our results show that most of the
employees are aged between 30-40 years. In reason of absence, the major causes of absenteeism
are diseases related to musculoskeletal system and connective tissues ,injury, poisoning(digestive
diseases), consultation for medical and dental diseases. Higher percentage of Social Drinkers are
absent as compared to Non Drinkers and Non Smokers. Many employees are absent in the month
of March. During the Spring season,many employees were absent.T
